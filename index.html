                Virginia is a constituent state, which means it was one of the original 13 colonies. 
                It is bordered by Maryland, Atlantic Ocean, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and West Virgina.
                Virginia has an old nick name of "Old Dominion". It got this nickname from its loyalty to the exiled
                Charles II of england durring 1653. The state of Virginia was orginally named after Elizabeth I.

                The history and nature of Virginia make it a popular place for tourism.
                Within the borders of Virginia lie many important historical monuments.
                Althought the state is Incorporated and Industrialized, much of the state
                remains under dorst cover as it descends from the mountains and balleus in
                west to the Atlantic shore.

        <h2>Flowering dogwood: state tree of Virginia</h2>
        <img src="Images/dogwood.jfif" alt="Photo of a Dogwood Tree">
            <p class="asideparagraph">
                The Dogwood was known for being a strong solid tree. It was used 
                in many buildings. It was the material to make the cross on which
                Jesus was crucified. He cursed the tree to never grow tall enough
                to be used in another cricifixion as a dogwood cross.

                <p>Dogwood tree physical characteristics:</p>
                <li>Small, low- branched tree</li>
                <li>Oval leaves of about 3-6 inches</li>
                <li>White flowers with 4 petals each</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="asideparagraph">
                Dogwood was used to treat dogs with mange, which could maybe be the orgin of
                its name. Not only is the Dogwood tree the state tree of Virgina, the actual 
                flower is the state flower of North Carolina.
